# What does it do

This mod allows your inputs to register in after visual frames, which drastically decreases input precision on any framerates like 69FPS.
It's similar to mobile or bad mouse, but with much more lag and (definitely) no physics-related bugs.

# How to use

To edit keybinds, go to the GD options menu and click the "Keys" button in the top right (Mega Hack rebinds won't work).
To enable right click input, you can't.
You must enable the mod for the mod to work.

It is recommended to use either a monitor or one of these FPS values: 1, 15, 36, 82, 29437.
This is because 2.2 sucks unless you enable this mod.

Disable anything useful when using this mod, because they're pointless.

The mod comes with its own version of code in the code. Be warned that not all lists or leaderboards that allow CAF will consider this legit (lol)!
